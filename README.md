# Network Traffic Analysis of Third-Party Android Applications

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze network traffic of third-party Android applications using `mitmproxy`. The primary goal is to identify and understand the data transmission patterns, security concerns, and potential privacy issues associated with these applications. By leveraging `mitmproxy`, we can monitor, capture, and analyze network packets to provide insightful reports on the behavior of these applications.

## Features

- Captures network traffic from Android devices using `mitmproxy`
- Analyzes traffic to identify data transmission patterns
- Detects potential security and privacy issues
- Generates comprehensive reports with visualizations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android device with developer options enabled
- [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) installed
- Python 3.x

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kalyan1998/Network-Traffic-Analysis-of-Third-Party-Android-Applications.git
    cd Network-Traffic-Analysis-of-Third-Party-Android-Applications
    ```

2. Install `mitmproxy`:
    ```bash
    pip install mitmproxy
    ```

## Usage

1. **Set Up mitmproxy**: Start `mitmproxy` to capture network traffic:
    ```bash
    mitmproxy -w capture.log
    ```

2. **Configure Android Device**: 
    - Connect your Android device to the same network as your PC.
    - Set up the device to use `mitmproxy` as an HTTP proxy.
    - Install the `mitmproxy` certificate on your Android device for HTTPS traffic capture.

3. **Capture Traffic**: Run the target applications on your Android device while `mitmproxy` captures the network traffic.

4. **Analyze Traffic**: Use the provided Python scripts to analyze the captured network traffic.
    ```bash
    python analyze_traffic.py capture.log
    ```
